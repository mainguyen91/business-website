            <p class="pretext">Our team consists of four persons who are full-time employed somewhere else. We
                gathered at nights or during the weekends to work on this game as a side project. If we won the lottery,
                we would quit our jobs and work full-time on our own game studio start-up.

                    <h3>BINH - Soul</h3>
                    <p>Binh can do everything: from designing to coding and publishing the game. He is highly motivated
                        and always pushes the team to work harder. His only weakness is his (lack of) ability to
                        communicate as a normal person. As soon as we get some profits, we will hire a personal
                        translator for him.

                            represented by a chimpanzee.)</i><br>Liem is in charge of tracking the financial situation
                        of the team and inform us how deeply in debt we are.

                    <p>Mai lives in a different time zone compared to the rest of the team, thus planning a conference
                        call with her is extra difficult. She writes most of the texts that you see in the game and
                        other communications. She is now busy with planning the contents of our upcoming Facebook page.

                    <p>Nguyen is a creative designer who spends 50% of her time at a full-time job, 50% on designing all
                        visual elements of our game, and 20% on thinking about her crush. The numbers do not add up to
                        100%? Yep, she is that bad at maths.
